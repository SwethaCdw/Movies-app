DEBUGGING EXERCISES SOLUTION GUIDE
===================================

## 🎬 EXERCISE 1: Movie Filter Bug
================================

### 🐛 THE BUG:
The "Coming Soon" filter shows no movies even though there should be movies with that category.

### 🔍 LOCATION:
Check `src/utils/movieUtils.ts` in the `getFilterMapping` function.

### 🤔 THE PROBLEM:
```typescript
if (uiValue === 'coming_soon') {  // ❌ Wrong! UI sends 'upcoming'
  return 'coming_soon';
}
```

### ✅ THE FIX:
Change to:
```typescript
if (uiValue === 'upcoming') {  // ✅ Correct! Matches UI value
  return 'coming_soon';
}
```

## 🎭 EXERCISE 2: Screenings Page Infinite Loader
===============================================

### 🐛 THE BUG:
The screenings page shows a loading spinner forever and never shows the movie screenings.

### 🔍 HOW TO TEST:
1. Run the app: `npm run dev`
2. Go to the Screenings page
3. Notice: Loading spinner spins forever! 🔄
4. The screenings list never appears

### 🤔 WHERE TO LOOK:
Check the `fetchScreenings` function in `src/app/screenings/page.tsx`:

```typescript
async function fetchScreenings() {
  try {
    setLoading(true);
    setError(null);
    
    // Simulate loading delay
    setTimeout(() => {
      setScreenings(mockScreenings);
      // BUG: setLoading(false) is missing! This causes infinite loading
    }, 1000);
    
  } catch (err) {
    setError('Failed to load screenings');
    setLoading(false);
  }
}
```

### 🕵️ DEBUGGING QUESTIONS:
1. What happens to `loading` state?
   - It gets set to `true` at the start
   - But when does it get set to `false`?

2. Look at the `setTimeout` block:
   - It sets the screenings data ✅
   - Does it stop the loading spinner? 🤔

3. What's missing?

### 💡 YOUR TASK:
Add ONE line of code to fix the infinite loading!

**Hint:** You need to tell React when loading is finished.

### ✅ THE SOLUTION:
Add `setLoading(false);` inside the setTimeout:

```typescript
setTimeout(() => {
  setScreenings(mockScreenings);
  setLoading(false);  // ← Add this line!
}, 1000);
```

### 🧪 TEST YOUR FIX:
After the fix:
- Loading spinner appears for 1 second
- Then shows the screenings list
- No more infinite loading!

### 🎓 LEARNING POINTS:
- **Loading states need to be managed** - Set to `true` when starting, `false` when done
- **Async operations** need to signal when they're complete
- **Missing state updates** can cause UI to get "stuck"
- Always think: "When does this loading stop?"

### 🧪 HOW TO TEST:
After fixing, the screenings page should:
1. Show loading spinner for ~1 second
2. Display the list of movie screenings
3. Show proper movie titles, auditoriums, and times

---

## 🎯 SUMMARY:
Both bugs involve **logic conditions that don't match the actual data flow**:
- Movie filter: UI value doesn't match condition check
- Screenings: Promise condition can never be satisfied

These are common debugging patterns - always trace the data flow! 🕵️‍♂️
