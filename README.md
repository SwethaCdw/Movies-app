# Movie Debugging Assignment

Welcome! This assignment is designed to test your debugging skills in a React/Next.js codebase. The app runs, but contains several intentional bugs. Your goal is to find and fix them.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   pnpm install
2. Run the development server:
   pnpm dev

## What to Debug

The app has the following issues:

- Movie filtering does not work as expected
- The hamburger icon does not open and close as expected
- All the test cases should pass.


Good luck!
